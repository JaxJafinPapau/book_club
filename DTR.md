Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):

We we know we will have been successful when all user stories are complete and functional. Skills we wish to strengthen are html/CSS styling, ActiveRecord/db interaction, and Rails usage.

Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):
Noah feels strong in MVC, TDD, and ActiveRecord
Jeremy feels strong in TDD and ActiveRecord
Rob feels strong in styling and implementing functionality from tests.

How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:

By guiding each other in areas of relative strength and weakness.

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have?):

We all generally arrive between a half hour and and hour before class, we will use this time to coordinate work expected for the day, after class we will usually stay til around 5, we will use this time to pair/trio code and coordinate individual work for the evenings.

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team?):

We will meet daily to check in about the project in person, all members will be available via Slack on evenings and weekends and will keep each other updated there for unseen times of unavailability.

Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):

We all want to improve our styling-foo, Rob wants to learn how to start down a solid TDD path, Jeremy wants to learn how to complete a simple Rails app.

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):

We will divide features that need completion during daily meetings and assign them on Waffle.io

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
All feedback will follow the SAK format. We will give reinforcement and improvement feedback as soon as possible to make sure that the feedback feels relevant to the subject, rather than disconnected by time.
